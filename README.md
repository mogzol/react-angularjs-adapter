# react-angularjs-adapter

This library allows you to mount AngularJS (AngularJS 1 only) components in React, and React components in AngularJS. It is based on [react2angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react2angular) and [angular2react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2react), with added support for React 19 and React contexts. The support for React contexts allows you to have a component hierarchy like `React Provider > AngularJS Component(s) > React Consumer` and the consumer will be able to access the provider's context even with the AngularJS components in-between.

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
